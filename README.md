This is a fork of https://github.com/leia-uwu/survev, but with more bug fixes and features.

# Open sourced surviv.io
Survev.io is an open source recreation of a hit web game "surviv.io" that has been permanently shut down.

Our goal is to immortalize it by getting the recreation as close as possible to the last canonical version of the game.

We do not consider any updates after the Kongregate acquisition canonical, so those will not be a part of the project.

## Running locally
